My program used 3 files: Main.java, Fred.java, and Wilma.java. To synchronize the threads for Fred and Wilma, I used two binary semaphores: one for when Fred is going upwards and one for when Wilma is going upwards. When it was Fred's turn to go up, his thread acquired his semaphore, updated the heights until he was at maximum height, and released Wilma's semaphore. Wilma's thread repeated this process of acquiring her semaphore, updating the heights, and releasing Fred's semaphore. The program alternates between the two for a total of 10 complete cycles of the see saw.
